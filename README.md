# hello-world
this repository is mark of a new beginning. 

I began not for power but for freedom. The choices we make, the thoughts we think, the stuff
we say influences the type of expeirences. Mindfulness is the awareness of the space in which thoughts arise. By trying to grasp and maintain that identity you've created for yourself, failure and dissapointment is inevitable. Become formless, become noone. Fear, jeolousy, and anxiety will become foreign. When one stops trying to make others percieved them in certain light, freedom arises. Follow you heart as they say. Live to serve a purpose. Live to serve a goal.
